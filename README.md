# Frame & Wall DeconSwap

Swaps the use of the wrench and grinder for deconstructing certain build states of frames and walls. The time to grind open an airtight frame is also slightly increased, from 0.5 to 0.75 second.

## Why swap?

"Unwelding" a sealed frame with a wrench (A) makes no sense and (B) is way too easy to do accidentally while working on your plumbing, causing dangerous hull breaches! (You've never had that happen, or nearly happen? Even when you were a 'noob'? Play long enough, and it will.)

Meanwhile, the initial setup step of frames and walls (which you do with your bare hands) require a grinder and battery charge to undo, even though most other construction tasks that are undone by a grinder are typically welding operations.

This mod brings more safety and sensibility to the situation by editing the relevant build states of frames and walls, swapping the use of wrench and grinder around so that frame welding steps are undone with the grinder, and the initial frame and wall setup (which requires no tool) is undone with the wrench. The time required to grind the airtight stage of a frame is also slightly increased.

With DeconSwap, dismantling pipes won't vent your base if you misclick, twitch, or hold the button a moment too long, and changing your mind about where you placed those last 100 walls or frames won't send you scrambling for fresh batteries.

## Mod loader instructions

This plugin requires BepInEx to run. If you're subscibing to it on the Steam workshop, you'll need StationeersLaunchPad as well. Instructions for both are here:
